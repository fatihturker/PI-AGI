- **ORM**: Mongoose, TypeORM, or Prisma

### Development Plan

1. Set up the Node.js project and configure the development environment.
2. Choose a web framework (e.g., Express or NestJS) and create the basic server structure.
3. Implement user authentication using the chosen authentication method (JWT or OAuth2).
4. Design and implement the API endpoints for user profiles and daily entries.
